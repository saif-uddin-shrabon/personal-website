<= MY Jpurney=>
 I believe every programmer is a self-taught programmer because we cannot become a better programmer without hard work from our side.
                    In 2016, I gained admission to study computer science. A computer scientist is someone who studies how a computer can be used to solve a wide range of problems and their applied mathematics. The only problem was that I didn’t know mathematics so well. I didn’t have a clue that was how computer science would be. I thought it was just about how to operate a computer — I didn’t even think to google it.
